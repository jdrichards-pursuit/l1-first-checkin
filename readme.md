# L1 First Checkpoint

This checkpoint is designed to test knowldege of the following topics:

- JavaScript/Data Structures and Algorithms
- React
- ExpressJS

## Instructions

Coaches will work through 3 sections of this checkpoint with fellows for a total of 45 minutes.

1. **JavaScript/Data Structures and Algorithms** - 15 minutes - Administer the coding problem in the dsa.js file. The fellow will solve the problem verbally. The fellow should be encouraged to ask questions about the problem, take their time and think out loud. When they are ready, they should answer the question in plain English for the coach to pseudocode. Next, if there is time the fellow should now verbally solve the problem in code.

2. **React** - 15 minutes - Show the student the react.jsx file. Ask them to explain what the component is doing line by line using technical terms.

3. **ExpressJS** - 15 minutes - Show the student the express.js file. Ask them to explain what the route is doing line by line using technical terms.


## Rubric

This rubric now provides a clear scoring system with a total of 100 points. The coding problem and React component analysis are weighted equally at 40 points each, reflecting their importance. The Express endpoint analysis is allocated 20 points.
